# Work queue: closing the scan-boundary vein

The ordered backlog for [SOUNDNESS-VEIN-crossing-the-scan-boundary.md](SOUNDNESS-VEIN-crossing-the-scan-boundary.md).
Written to be picked up cold — by a fresh session, or by an agent — without needing anyone's context.

**Why this is the top of the queue.** It is the only known defect that makes a `deny` gate pass code it
should fail, it reproduces in all four engines, and it is gate-level rather than report-level. PAPER1 §6.1b
now scopes the headline claim because of it.

## THE STANDING BAR — applies to every item, no exceptions

1. **The cardinal sin is a SILENT UNDER-REPORT.** Never trade it for its mirror. A fix that FABRICATES an
   effect on a genuinely pure function is worse than the miss it closes. If an A/B shows gains you cannot
   trace to a real reach, **revert**. Three swift fixes were reverted this way before a fourth landed clean;
   that is the expected rhythm, not a failure.
2. **A/B on real code, every change.** Scan several real codebases before and after and diff per-function
   effect sets. Report gains AND losses. Zero losses required. Every gain traced to source, not assumed.
   Watch the report ENTRY COUNT too — a spurious extra entry means an unbounded edge (this caught a bad
   drop-glue marker).
3. **Two-tree fixture per fix**, with the single-tree control, and the `deny` gate going from exit 0 back to
   exit 1. The control is what proves it is a *boundary* defect and not a general limitation.
4. **Regression test per fix**, engine's own suite green, four-way conformance green.
5. **Verify before claiming.** Several sweep findings did not reproduce (see the corrections in the vein
   doc). Reduce every mechanism story to a fixture before acting on it.
6. **Honest beats silent.** If a mechanism cannot be resolved soundly, making it disclose `Unknown` is a
   valid and valuable fix.
7. **Delete the output before you measure a control.** A crashed or stale run leaves the previous report on
   disk, and reading it back silently reports the wrong arm's result. This has now bitten three times in this
   vein — twice via a stale `*-all.jar` picked by `ls … | head -1`, once via a pre-fix ts worktree with no
   `node_modules`. Every time, the fabricated datapoint pointed the *flattering* way.
8. Commit each fix separately, substantive message, trailers:
   `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>` and the session `Claude-Session:` line.
   **Do not push without an explicit instruction.**

## The template that works

Emit the call shape the cross-package join **already understands**, rather than adding a resolution path.
The dependency's report almost always already holds the right answer under the right key — in 12 of 13 JVM
cases it did, and nothing looked for it. Two caveats learned the hard way:

- The emitted shape must be **distinguishable from a real call**, or it pollutes the κ ledger and the
  coverage envelope (`cr::<drop>::Type`, not `cr::Type::drop`).
- **Bound it at consumption**: join it and `continue`, so it can never reach local resolution or the
  classifier.

## A cross-engine precedent tells you an approach CAN work. It does not specify the guard.

R4 is the case study, and the mistake was mine. R4 sat blocked as *"a decision, not a patch"*; I unblocked it
by citing swift's `eae2de2`, which had shipped the same idea safely behind one carve-out, and I decided for
**resolution 1 (provenance)** on that basis. Measured, resolution 1 *as I specified it* produced **32 fresh
Unknowns on serde_json** — worse than the 30 that had caused the original revert. `serde::Serialize` genuinely
IS a dependency trait, so provenance waves it through.

The discriminator that actually works is **erasure**, which was in neither the queue nor the precedent: a
`dyn` receiver is type-erased, so the crate's local impls really are its candidate witnesses; a `T: Trait`
bound or an `impl Trait` param is monomorphized *by the caller*, so they are not. Two further carve-outs
(`self`/`crate`/`super` roots, nested-item scoping) were each found the same way — by a flood on real code,
not by reasoning.

So: the precedent was good evidence that the shape was reachable, and no evidence at all about which guard
made it safe. **Cite a precedent to justify attempting something; measure to find out what it costs.** And
the reverse now needs checking too — swift's carve-out does not appear to distinguish erased from
monomorphized receivers, so the engine that supplied the precedent may itself be fabricating. That is being
probed; a precedent inherits the other engine's unexamined assumptions along with its result.

## Queue

### rust — 4 of 5 done (R5 is the only one left)
- [x] implicit stringification via a dep's `Display::fmt` — `1623a07`
- [x] drop glue via a dep's `Drop` — `a2fbe74`
- [x] `interfaceUnion` emitted in `--deps` child scans — `50218e3`
- [x] **R4 — imported-trait dispatch — `1950a27`.** DECIDED as resolution 1 (provenance) and shipped, with
      the test that said "external-trait local impl must not resolve (fabrication)" **unchanged and still
      passing**: it uses a bare `Iterator`, which needs no `use`, so `expand` leaves it unqualified and the
      provenance gate keeps it out. The hazard it protects is untouched.

      **Resolution 1 as written is NOT enough, and only measuring showed that.** It needs THREE carve-outs,
      each one a flood found on real code, each pinned by a verified-to-catch control:
      1. **provenance** — a genuine dependency crate root. std/core/alloc out (the `Iterator` case), AND
         `self`/`crate`/`super` out: a `use` binding keeps the text it was written with, so value-bag's
         `pub use self::error::Error` made std's `Error` look dependency-qualified — **17 fresh Unknowns**.
      2. **erasure** — the receiver must be spelled `dyn`. `serde::Serialize`/`Serializer` ARE dependency
         traits, so provenance passes them; CHA-ing serde_json's five `impl Serializer` types onto its
         GENERIC entry points put **32 fresh Unknowns** on serde_json (`to_string`, `to_vec`, `to_writer`).
         A `dyn` receiver is erased and the local impls are its candidate witnesses; a `T: Trait` bound or
         `impl Trait` param is monomorphized BY THE CALLER, so they are not. With this, serde_json is 0.
      3. **nested-item scope** (a leak this rung exposed, not previously recorded) — a `fn`/`impl` inside a
         body has its own signature but its calls are attributed to the enclosing unit, so its params
         SHADOW the outer ones. value-bag's `internal_visit(v: &dyn Serialize)` declares a nested
         `impl Serializer` whose `serialize_some<T: Serialize>(self, v: &T)` inherited the outer `v`'s
         `dyn`-ness.

      ADDITIVE and PRECISE-OR-NOTHING (the swift template): edges only, bounded at 12 impls, and
      `unresolved` is NOT set on the wide/absent arms — the local impl set is a LOWER bound on the true one,
      so a wide one stays the documented miss rather than flooding Unknown.

      A/B: 12 real crates zero gains/losses/entry-delta/Unknown-delta. Then the **whole local crates.io
      registry (976 crates) swept with the rung instrumented**, to find where it is LIVE rather than assume:
      6 crates, 35 firings, every one traced (rustls-webpki `&dyn pki_types::SignatureVerificationAlgorithm`
      → Ring/AwsLcRs is the R4 shape exactly); A/B on all 6 clean. **Worth carrying: on that corpus the only
      `dyn`-spelled external traits are `Write`, `Iterator` and `Error` — i.e. every firing the carve-outs
      block is a real fabrication, and the carve-outs are the whole safety margin, not belt-and-braces.**
      Known over-fire, bounded: there is no external analogue of the local arm's `trait_declares_method`
      guard, so a blanket-trait method on a `dyn` receiver (hyper 0.14's `.into()` on a `&dyn Stream`) forms
      an edge that dangles. Zero measured effect.
- [ ] **R5 — the untyped cross-package receiver. NOW HAS A DESIGN:
      [DEP-RECEIVER-TYPING-DESIGN.md](DEP-RECEIVER-TYPING-DESIGN.md).** The key finding is that it SPLITS,
      and the first half needs no format change: an engine always knows whether it FORMED A KEY, and
      `keyed-and-missed` (a genuine purity claim under §2 rule 3) vs `could-not-form-a-key` (no question was
      asked; silence licenses nothing) is a distinction available today. Half 1 = disclose the unformed key,
      triggered on the CONJUNCTION *untyped receiver AND provenance in a chained package* — not on untyped
      receivers generally, which would be the 8-25% false-uncertainty flood the coverage finding measured.
      Do half 1 per engine on its own schedule; it stops the report lying while the rung is negotiated, and
      it survives half 2 as the fail-closed floor for receivers half 2 still cannot type.
      Original framing kept below, since it is what half 2 addresses:
      **return types in the report.** A receiver bound from a dep factory (`let c = deplib::build();
      c.fetch()`) is untyped, so every later method call drops. Needs a `returns` field in the report
      format — spec-visible, so it wants a rung and four-way agreement. Largest item here, and now the last.
- [x] **R6 — fully-qualified `&dyn deplib::Handler` — `7a5fc1d`.** The cause was one line of lossy indexing:
      `bound_leaves` keeps only `segments.last()` (every downstream index is leaf-keyed), and with no `use`
      to expand through the crate identity was simply GONE — `expand` returned a bare `Handler`, the
      `contains("::")` test failed, and the site emitted nothing at all: no dep key, no CHA, no disclosure.
      `sig_trait_quals` keeps the path the signature wrote; `crate`/`self`/`super` spellings are excluded
      because `expand` STRIPS those roots and would hand back a dependency-looking path (carve-out 1 by a
      second door). Gate exit 0 → 1.

      A/B, the whole 976-crate registry: **one** effect change and zero losses — tracing 0.1.44
      `__macro_support::__tracing_log` PURE → `['Log']`, traced to
      `__tracing_log(logger: &'static dyn log::Log, …) { logger.log(…) }`. The key now formed is
      `log::Log::log`, a rule the classifier already had and had never been handed. **855 new report entries
      across 60 crates, all with EMPTY effect sets** — functions that were ABSENT (which in this format IS a
      purity claim) and now carry `invisible: [<dep>]`. Unknown delta across all 976: zero. The same rung
      makes candor's own `span_lint(cx: &impl rustc_lint::LintContext)` read Log.

      Residual, asserted in the test so it cannot drift: the erasure carve-out means the generic-bound and
      `impl Trait` spellings of an imported trait still do not CHA local impls.

### java — 4 mechanism families DONE (fixture 15 silent-pure → 0, four gates exit 0 → 1)
- [x] implicit stringification + equals/hashCode reentry — `bdf272c`. `reentryEdge` ended in a project-only
      `chaTargets`, and **an empty CHA emitted no Unknown, only a dropped edge**. New `nearestDepFn` — the
      cross-boundary analogue of `nearestConcreteSuper` — plus a shared `inheritDepFn` fold.
      *Independently verified here:* `app.S.show -> ['Env']`, gate exit 1.
- [x] inherited / default methods from a dep supertype — `a5b0a41`. `this.load()` compiles to invokevirtual
      with the PROJECT class as owner, so the join was never reached; the subclass's own ClassNode names its
      dep parent, so the chain is walkable from this side.
- [x] callback / HOF hand-off — `b891d5f`. Method refs join on the handle's exact owner+name+desc; a
      constructed functional takes the type's reported surface, gated on the PARAMETER being a functional
      interface.
- [ ] **dep-interface-typed dispatch to a dep impl** — needs the dependency's own HIERARCHY, which the report
      format does not carry. Live residual, measured (jackson `WritableObjectId.generateId` loses `Rand`
      through `ObjectIdGenerator`). Same family as rust R5 / swift factory-receiver: a format extension.
- [ ] by-NAME reentry contracts (`compareTo`/`append`/`write`/`read`) — resolve over any descriptor, so
      there is no single hash to join on.

**A fabrication caught mid-flight, worth carrying:** the first version imported dep entries whose whole
content is `Unknown`, which turned **12 fully-resolved jackson-databind functions Unknown** from one method
`ObjectIdGenerator`/`ResolvedType.isReferenceType()`. Guard: skip a bare-`Unknown` dep entry when the
project CHA resolves the same signature. Measured with the guard removed — suppresses exactly 14 functions
across six pairs, all Unknown-only, **never a real effect**.

**Two operational traps:** dep reports are VERSION-GATED (generate with the same jar you test with or it is
silently treated as stale); and `build/libs` can hold MORE THAN ONE `-all.jar`, so a glob picks the stale one
— that cost two false negatives here before it was spotted. The stale 0.23.0 artifact has been removed.

### ts — all 4 confirmed mechanisms DONE
- [x] the monorepo symlink shape — a symlinked workspace dep produced **no disclosure at all** because the
      blind branch was guarded on `/node_modules/` — `6fb2560`
- [x] implicit coercion into a dep's `toString`/`valueOf`/`toJSON` — `625e8fd`
- [x] `new DepClass()` never consulting the chained dep report — `965ac82`
- [x] a dep function passed BY REFERENCE to an invoking HOF — `75ec3f6`

All four follow the rust template: no new resolution path — each routes its declaration through the decision
procedure the CallExpression path already runs (chained report → §5.1 manifest → κ ledger), factored into one
`chargeExternalDecl`. Gate on the two-package fixture, `deny Fs`, identical source: one project **exit 1** →
split+chained **exit 0** → now **exit 1**, matching the one-project control on all three mechanisms.

A/B, 13 real targets unchained: 0 effect gains, 0 losses, 166 invisible gains, 0 invisible losses. Chained
over 4 ukri-tfs services: 7 effect gains, 0 losses — every one tracing to
`@ukri-tfs/common#ServiceHostNamesFromAwsServiceDiscovery.constructor -> ['Clock','Env']` reaching
`createServiceHostNamesForDsApi`, which went from absent-from-the-report (a purity claim) to `['Clock','Env']`.

The coercion arm's anti-flood property was measured under load rather than assumed: the arm is entered a few
hundred times on the corpus and contributes nothing every time, because every resolution lands on the ES lib
or `@types/node` (`Buffer.toString`), both excluded by design.

**Verified independently before PART 20's ts row was added**, on a fixture outside the harness: pre-fix
candor-ts writes `0 effectful functions` for the consumer, post-fix `src.index.show -> ['Env']`. *The first
attempt at that control was worthless* — the pre-fix worktree had no `node_modules`, so the scan crashed and
left the POST-fix report on disk to be read back as if it were the pre-fix result. **Delete the output before
you measure a control** (now item 8 of the standing bar).

Residual, still open:
- The `--dep-inits` precision cost — all of a package's module units share one hash, so importing charges the
  union of every file's top level (`proper-lockfile` picked up `Net` from `retry`'s `example/dns.js`). Narrow
  to the resolved entry.
- **Interface-union needs source.** A published package ships `dist` JS + `.d.ts`, so the `implements` clause
  lives only in the typings and the child scan emits no union entry.

### swift — 6 of 7 gate-flipping mechanisms DONE
- [x] implicit stringification of a dep type, all three operand forms — `83ca73c` (verified independently:
      `describeTyped -> ['Env']` across the boundary, gate back to exit 1)
- [x] dependency `deinit` glue — `41dc8de`
- [x] dispatch over an IMPORTED protocol with LOCAL conformers — `eae2de2`. Needs no dep report: Swift
      spells a conformance to an imported protocol in the same inheritance clause, so `subtypesOf` already
      had it. **Note the carve-out that made it safe** — `enum Rank: String` puts `String` in the inheritance
      clause, so an unguarded CHA sends every call on a String-typed value into raw-value enums' methods;
      `RAW_VALUE_BASE_TYPES` closes it and a test pins it. *This is the swift analogue of the same trap rust
      hit at R4: an imported-supertype CHA is only safe with an explicit carve-out.*
- [ ] **factory-bound receiver** — the one gate still flipping 1 → 0. `let c = build(); c.fetch()`: `c` is
      untyped because no return types travel, AND the dep's `build` is pure so it is not even in the report —
      there is no evidence `c` came from the dep at all. Blocked on the same report-format extension as
      rust's R5. A leaf-key join (`M#fetch`) was considered and rejected: leaves like `write`/`run`/`send`
      would fabricate on unrelated receivers.
- Residual: the dep-CONFORMER direction of the protocol case is recovered only under `--workspace` (child
  scans emit the union entries); a plain `--deps` report carries no hierarchy. Pinned as a residual in the
  test rather than invented.

### cross-cutting
- [~] **Coverage granularity — CHARACTERISED, split into three arms, one worth fixing.**
      Full write-up + fixtures + measured blast radius:
      [COVERAGE-GRANULARITY-FINDING.md](COVERAGE-GRANULARITY-FINDING.md). The one-line item above
      conflated three mechanisms:
      - **A, dynamic** (`dep_classified` rust `scan.rs:836/1061/1252`; `kappaClassified` java
        `Candor.java:714/1719`): ONE *classified* call marks the whole package covered, deleting the
        `invisible` hedge from every other floored call into it — including packages the source
        deliberately left ledgered (`Rules.java:666`: "an unmodeled member … discloses `invisible` — the
        honest floor"). **A real defect, rust + java only.** Fixtures: rust `pnet_datalink`
        (`interfaces()` floors, `channel()` → Net), java `org.apache.commons.io`
        (`FilenameUtils.getName` floors, `FileUtils.readFileToString` → Fs). In both, the untouched
        function goes from `invisible:[pkg]` to **absent-from-report with `analyzed` counting it** — i.e.
        ⟨0.21⟩ *provably pure*, a positive claim. **FIX:** delete `dep_classified` / `kappaClassified` from
        the ledger filter; the reviewed prefix/crate list and §2 chaining remain the only coverage claims.
        Cost measured: java **422 methods / 18 692 (2.3%)** on warroot, **0** on petclinic; rust **0** on
        pgman/ebman/candor-rust (the mechanism can only fire on `pnet_datalink`/`pnet_transport` — every
        other crate name `classify()` matches is already in `CALIBRATED_*`). Wants a PART 4c sibling:
        adding a classified call into P must not remove `invisible:[P]` from an unrelated function.
      - **B, curated** (the reviewed name lists): four-way, and **SPEC §7 item 14 exempts it by name.**
        Making it per-call-site adds a hedge to **8.0% (pgman) / 14.2% (ebman) / 15.3% (warroot) /
        24.6% (petclinic)** of all analyzed functions — tokio handles, aws_sdk builders, chrono
        arithmetic, Struts beans. **Not adoptable.** swift already tried and reverted exactly this
        (`Driver.swift:732`, "rampant false uncertainty", sweep [33]/[36]). The right pattern for the
        sharp cases is java's structural Spring floor (`Candor.java:1724`), one library family at a time.
      - **C, chained** (`deps_idx.crates` / `depCoveredPkgs` / `coveredPkgs`): four-way and **SPEC §2
        chaining rule 3 mandates it.** The R5 fixture reproduces the confidence loss (control
        `go -> ['Env']`; unchained `go -> [] invisible:['deplib']`; chained `go` absent, no coverage
        field) but the fix is not granularity — it is distinguishing **keyed-and-missed** (a real purity
        claim; stay silent) from **could-not-form-a-key** (`c.fetch()` on an untyped receiver; should
        hedge). Today the `scan.rs:1033` guard means an unkeyable call never enters the join arm at all,
        so the two are indistinguishable at the ledger. Folds into R5/R6/factory-receiver.
      - ts and swift **refute** arm A outright: `kappaKnows` (`scan-core.mjs:234`) and
        `PLATFORM_MODULES`/`KAPPA_MODULES` (`main.swift:526`) are pure functions of the package NAME, and
        `depCoveredPkgs`/`coveredPkgs` are populated at report-LOAD time. No call site can move a package
        from uncovered to covered. Fixtures in the write-up show both arms identical.
- [x] **Conformance PART 20** pinning the boundary contract four-way — `3bd69ec` (java/rust/swift) then
      `08b796a` (ts joins). Verified-to-catch on each engine's row by unchaining that engine's consumer:
      the row goes DIVERGE and the suite FAILED while the others still match.
- [ ] **PAPER1 §6.1b / PAPER2 §4.6b** are written against the current state — update the counts as
      mechanisms close, and re-scope if the claim can be restored.

## Done-ness

The vein is closed when, for each engine, the two-tree fixture matches its single-tree control on every
mechanism in the table, PART 20 is green and verified-to-catch, and PAPER1 §6.1b can be rewritten from
"currently false" to a bounded residual.
