# Principles

candor's design — and how each implementation gets built — follow one idea:

> **Honesty under uncertainty.** A tool for understanding code, leaned on by people and
> AI agents who can't double-check it, is worth only what you can trust it to be straight
> about — especially about what it *doesn't* know.

Everything below is that idea applied at a different level. Each was earned building the family's
first implementation (Rust); the moment it cost something to follow is noted, so these stay principles
we *demonstrated*, not slogans.

### 1. Honest uncertainty beats false confidence

When the tool can't tell, it says so — it never guesses "fine." A call it can't resolve becomes a
visible `Unknown` (AS-EFF-003), never a silent "pure." A baseline it can't load shouts "guard is NOT
active" rather than passing quietly. **Silent false-negatives and silent false-greens are the worst
failure mode there is, because they're trusted.**

### 2. The guarantee is the product — never ship one you can't keep

For a checker, an *unsound* guarantee is negative value: worse than nothing, because people rely on
it. The Rust impl refused to ship reachability/dead-code analysis because, on an incomplete call
graph, it would confidently mislabel live code as dead — and a confident wrong answer is more
dangerous than no answer.

### 3. Ride the world; don't reinvent it

Corpus fluency beats elegant novelty — which is why candor is a *profile over an existing language*,
not a new one (the reference impl rides Rust + dylint; the Java impl rides WALA/SootUp). Compose with
what exists (it recognizes cap-std; it defers to whole-program tools when that's the real need). Meet
code and teams where they are: an adoption ladder (audit → guard → no-ambient → strict) that pays off
without a rewrite.

### 4. Reality is the reviewer — a green build proves nothing

Every claim is tested on real code, and reality is allowed to correct the design. The precision
lesson (match the call, not the crate) had to be learned three times; a live eval surfaced a whole
class of missed network calls; running on a second real project surfaced a false-positive class no
synthetic test had. We trust what we ran, not what compiled.

### 5. Verify from outside — nothing certifies itself

A thing cannot certify itself. An A/B eval let a source-reading agent catch what the tool missed; an
independent review caught claims we'd have rationalized. candor even audits candor — and we noted it
*cannot* catch its own classifier's blind spots. Self-assessment is necessary and never sufficient.

### 6. Match the boundary, not the label

Precision where it counts: classify the actual effect-causing call (`.send()`, a process spawn, a
socket), not the library around it. Over-reporting erodes trust as surely as under-reporting hides
danger — both are dishonesty about what the code does.

### 7. Defer out loud, with reasons

Scope we drop is written down with its concrete blocker, never silently narrowed. Each implementation
carries its own critique and unfinished list (e.g. the Rust impl's `CRITIQUE.md` / `BACKLOG.md`).
"We didn't do X, here's exactly why" is a feature.

---

If you want it in three: **be honest about uncertainty · validate against reality · verify from
outside.** If you want it in one, it's the line at the top.

None of this is language-specific. It's how to build any tool meant to be trusted — and doubly so
any tool an AI agent will rely on without re-checking.
