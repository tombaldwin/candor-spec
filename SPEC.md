# The candor specification

A candor *implementation* analyzes a codebase in one language and reports, per function, the set of
side effects it performs. This document defines what every implementation must produce, so that a
report is interchangeable across languages — for an AI agent, a human, or a CI gate.

**Version 0.3.** The **spec/contract version** — the report schema, the effect vocabulary, and the
`AS-EFF` codes — that a conformant implementation declares it implements. It is distinct from an engine's
*build id* and from a package's *release version* (§2.1): the published Rust crates are at `0.3.x`, the
JVM port builds from a git hash, and both declare **spec `0.3`**. An implementation MUST emit the spec
version it conforms to in every report (the envelope's `spec`, §2/§2.1) and SHOULD expose it as a
constant. The report is wrapped in a self-describing `{ candor, functions }` envelope (§2); the legacy
v0.1 bare array is still accepted by conformant readers during migration. See the [changelog](#8-changelog).

> This document fixes the **interface** an implementation must produce. For the **analysis** behind
> it — the effect lattice, call-site resolution rules, the transitive fixpoint, cross-crate
> composition, and the soundness/precision properties — see [SEMANTICS.md](SEMANTICS.md).

## 1. Effects

An **effect** is an observable interaction with the world outside pure computation. The shared
vocabulary:

| Effect | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Net` | network I/O — sockets, HTTP clients, cloud-SDK request dispatch |
| `Fs` | filesystem read/write |
| `Db` | database query execution |
| `Exec` | spawning / controlling a subprocess |
| `Env` | reading environment variables / the process environment |
| `Clock` | reading wall-clock or monotonic time |
| `Ipc` | local inter-process communication (e.g. Unix-domain sockets) |
| `Log` | logging / tracing |
| `Rand` | randomness / entropy |
| `Clipboard` | system clipboard access |
| `Unknown` | a call the implementation **could not resolve** — see §4 |

An implementation MAY add language-specific effects, but SHOULD use these names where they apply.
`Unknown` is mandatory and special.

## 2. The report

An implementation emits, per compilation unit, a self-describing **envelope** — a provenance header
plus one entry per analyzed function (or other *reportable item*, e.g. a static initializer). Write
one file per unit, named so multiple units don't collide (the Rust impl uses
`<prefix>.<crate>.<type>.json`):

```json
{
  "candor":    { "version": "<engine build id>", "toolchain": "<channel>", "spec": "0.3" },
  "functions": [ /* the entries below */ ]
}
```

The `candor` header records which engine produced the report (§2.1). A bare top-level array (no
envelope) remains accepted as the legacy **v0.1** form — readers MUST accept both during migration.

Each entry:

```json
{
  "fn":           "<fully-qualified function name>",
  "loc":          "<file:line:col>",
  "inferred":     ["Net", "Fs", "..."],  // FULL TRANSITIVE effect set (this fn + everything it calls)
  "direct":       ["Fs"],                // effects performed in this fn's own body only
  "declared":     [],                    // effects the signature declares it may perform (§5)
  "undeclared":   [],                    // inferred − declared (violations); empty in audit
  "overdeclared": [],                    // declared − inferred (unused declarations)
  "unresolved":   true,                  // true if `inferred` may be incomplete (contains Unknown)
  "entryPoint":   false,                  // OPTIONAL: true if the RUNTIME invokes this fn, not (only)
                                         // project code — a reachability ROOT. The language/framework
                                         // surface that has no in-project caller: `main`, test/exported
                                         // (`#[no_mangle]`) fns; on the JVM the much larger reflective
                                         // surface — finalize, Runnable/Callable task bodies, servlet
                                         // and Spring lifecycle (@PostConstruct/@PreDestroy, web/queue
                                         // handlers, JPA callbacks). Lets a consumer compute the effects
                                         // reachable from the roots; its body's effects are NEVER
                                         // orphaned. Population is runtime-specific — far richer on a
                                         // reflection/framework runtime than on Rust. Default false.
  "unknownWhy":   ["dispatch:Foo.bar"],  // OPTIONAL: when this fn introduces `Unknown` DIRECTLY, why —
                                         // `reflect:<callee>` (reflection / dynamic invoke),
                                         // `native:<method>` (no analysable body), or
                                         // `dispatch:<type>.<method>` (a project abstraction with no
                                         // visible impl). Lets a consumer tell irreducible opacity
                                         // (reflection, native) from the improvable kind (a missing
                                         // impl — widen the analysed inputs). Omitted when this fn
                                         // introduces no direct Unknown.
  "hash":         "<stable cross-crate id>", // OPTIONAL: a stable identity (e.g. DefPathHash) so a
                                         // dependent crate's analysis can inherit this fn's effects
                                         // across the crate boundary. Per-crate analyzers SHOULD
                                         // emit it; consumers may ignore it.
  "calls":        ["..."],               // OPTIONAL: effectful local functions this one calls — the
                                         // effect-relevant call graph, so a consumer can answer
                                         // "who calls X?" from the report without re-analysis.
  "fs":           ["read", "write"],     // OPTIONAL: when `Fs` is present, which kinds — `read`
                                         // and/or `write`. Omitted when the kind can't be
                                         // determined (see below); never a partial claim.
  "hosts":        ["api.example.com"],   // OPTIONAL: when `Net` is present, the LITERAL endpoints
                                         // statically visible (`host[:port]`). Omitted when the
                                         // address is runtime-computed (see below); never complete.
  "cmds":         ["git"],               // OPTIONAL: when `Exec` is present, the LITERAL subprocess
                                         // commands statically visible. Same rules as `hosts`.
  "paths":        ["/etc/app"]           // OPTIONAL: when `Fs` is present, the LITERAL filesystem
                                         // paths statically visible. Same rules as `hosts`.
}
```

`inferred` MUST be transitive: if A calls B and B performs `Net`, A's `inferred` includes `Net` —
**including when B lives in another crate of the same project**. `direct` is the non-transitive
subset. Effect-free items MAY be omitted from the report.

`hash` is optional *only* for single-crate analysis. As soon as A and B are in different crates,
`hash` is the join key a dependent uses to inherit B's effects, so a multi-crate implementation MUST
emit it to satisfy the transitivity rule above — otherwise every cross-crate call is silently dropped
and the boundary function *under*-reports (the dangerous direction). A consumer may still ignore
`hash`; a producer of multi-crate reports may not omit it.

`fs` refines the `Fs` effect into `read` / `write` kinds — the detail a consumer needs to tell a
read-only function from one that mutates the disk. It applies only when `inferred` contains `Fs`. An
implementation that resolves the kind SHOULD emit it; one that can't (or doesn't track it) MAY omit
it. Crucially, when `Fs` is reached but its kind is *unknown* — e.g. inherited from a sibling/dep
report (§2.1) that carried no `fs`, so no read/write is locally observable — the field MUST be
**omitted rather than guessed**. An empty or partial `fs` would be read as a positive claim ("reads
but never writes"), which is the §4 trust contract's forbidden direction (under-claiming an effect).
Omission says "`Fs`, kind undetermined"; a present `fs` is an affirmative read/write classification.

`hosts` refines the `Net` effect with the endpoint(s) a call talks to, but **only the statically
decidable subset**: a string-*literal* address or URL (`connect("rates.internal:7070")`,
`get("https://api.example.com/v1")`) yields a host (`host[:port]`, scheme and path stripped); a
runtime-computed address yields none. It applies only when `inferred` contains `Net`. Unlike `fs`,
`hosts` is **never a completeness claim**: host-by-runtime-value is undecidable, so an absent or
partial `hosts` means "these are the endpoints I could see," NOT "the function talks to no others."
A consumer MUST treat it as informative, never as a closed allow-list — and an implementation MUST
NOT emit a host it merely inferred (only ones it read from a literal), so a present entry is always
sound. This keeps it within the §4 trust contract: `Net` already carries the "performs network I/O"
claim; `hosts` only ever *narrows* it with what's provably visible.

`cmds` (for `Exec`) and `paths` (for `Fs`) follow the **same rules as `hosts`**: the statically-decidable
literal subset only (a `Command::new("git")` / `fs::read("/etc/x")` literal, never a runtime value),
informative-not-complete, never emitted unless read from a literal. The three together are the literal
surfaces an `allow <Effect>` policy rule (AS-EFF-008) enforces; a producer SHOULD emit them so a
dependent crate's allowlist can see a value that lives across the crate boundary.

### 2.1 Provenance (the `candor` header)

A report is only meaningful relative to the engine that produced it: a richer classifier or a new
resolution rule changes the effect set for the *same* source, so a baseline is comparable only to its
own producing version, and a dependent crate must not silently trust a sibling report from a different
engine (the trust contract, §4, applied to candor's own output). The envelope's `candor` header
carries this — `version` (engine build id) and `toolchain` — so the report is self-describing.

The header has THREE fields, on two distinct axes — keep them separate:

- `version` — the engine **build identity** (a build id / git hash / release tag). It answers "which
  binary produced this?" and MUST reflect the binary that **actually ran**, not the source tree it was
  built from — those diverge when the source is updated without a rebuild, and a source-derived version
  would call a stale engine "current" and mask a stale baseline. A consumer performing cross-crate
  inheritance (§2, `hash`) SHOULD compare `version` and, on a mismatch, treat the inherited effects as
  unverified (downgrade to `Unknown`) rather than trust them.
- `toolchain` — the language/runtime channel (`nightly-…`, `stable`, `jdk-21`).
- `spec` — the **candor-spec contract version** this engine implements (`"0.3"`). This is the version
  *this document* carries, NOT the engine's build id or the package's release version — they evolve
  independently (a binary-only scanner fix bumps the release, not the spec). An implementation MUST emit
  `spec` so a consumer can tell which contract a report conforms to, and SHOULD source it from a single
  constant (the Rust reference: `candor_report::SPEC_VERSION`). A report without `spec` predates this
  field and is treated as spec ≤ 0.2.

The Rust reference impl additionally embeds `version` in the dylib itself (so a tool can read the
*true* build version without running the engine) and mirrors `version`/`toolchain` into its
`<prefix>.calibrated.json` sidecar; for a **legacy v0.1 bare-array** report that has no header, an
implementation MAY fall back to that sidecar for provenance.

### 2.2 The call-graph sidecar

Alongside each report, an implementation that provides the blast-radius or structural tools (§3.1–3.2)
emits a **call-graph sidecar** named `<prefix>.<crate>.<type>.callgraph.json` — a JSON object mapping each
function (by the same fully-qualified name used in the report) to the functions it directly calls:

```json
{ "a::caller": ["b::callee", "b::other"], "b::callee": ["c::leaf"] }
```

Crucially, unlike the report — which omits pure functions and records only effect-relevant `calls` — the
sidecar records EVERY project function's edges, **including pure ones**. That is what lets a consumer
answer *"who transitively calls X?"* for a function that is currently **pure** — the blast radius an agent
needs *before* introducing an effect. The sidecar is OPTIONAL, but an implementation that provides the
`callers` / `whatif` / `rewire` tools (§3.1–3.2) MUST emit it: those cannot answer the pre-edit question
from the report alone (a pure X is absent from the report). It carries no provenance of its own and is read
together with its report.

## 3. Modes

An implementation SHOULD support:

- **audit** (default) — report each function's `inferred` set; no judgement.
- **JSON** — write the §2 report to a file for machine/agent consumption.
- **conformance** — given functions that *declare* capabilities (§5), flag mismatches (§6). MAY be
  scoped to a module/path prefix for incremental adoption.
- **no-ambient** — flag any *direct* use of ambient authority (an effect performed without holding a
  matching capability), pushing toward a capability-passing / capability-secure style.
- **baseline guard** — diff against a saved report and flag functions that *gained* an effect.
- **policy** — enforce declared effect boundaries (e.g. "the `domain` layer must perform no `Net`/`Db`",
  "module `parse` must be pure"); flag any function that *transitively* violates one. The architectural
  invariant an agent can't see from a local edit.
- **risk** (optional, **heuristic**) — flag an effect whose argument derives from a function parameter
  (e.g. `fs::read(path_from_param)`) — the injection class (path traversal, command injection, SSRF).
  Unlike the others this is *advisory and imprecise*: a syntactic, intra-procedural nudge that over- and
  under-flags; it MUST NOT gate. An implementation MAY support it; if so it MUST document its limits.
- **containment** (optional) — a diagnostic over the report: for each *boundary* effect, how concentrated
  it is in one architectural layer (§6.1). With a baseline it becomes a *ratchet* (AS-EFF-010). It is
  deliberately **not** a single "score" — see §6.1.

### 3.1 Read-only queries (SHOULD)

A written report (§2) plus its call-graph sidecar (§2.2) answers structural questions WITHOUT re-analysis.
An implementation SHOULD expose them so an agent reaches for them in one cheap call instead of grepping:

- **show `<fn>`** — a function's effects (own/direct vs inherited).
- **where `<Effect>`** — which functions perform an effect (direct sources vs transitive inheritors).
- **callers `<fn>`** — the **blast radius**: every TRANSITIVE caller of `<fn>` (works for ANY function,
  including a still-**pure** one) — *who is affected if you change it*.
- **map** — a module → effects overview.
- **diff `<baseline>`** — the per-function effect delta (gained / lost) versus a saved report.
- **reachable / path / impact** — the runtime effect surface (union over entry points), an effect's
  provenance (the call chain to its source), and the blast radius from entry points.

These are an interface convenience, **not** part of the wire contract — a consumer that only reads the JSON
report is fully conformant. An implementation SHOULD keep query **names and output shapes consistent across
languages**, so an agent uses a report from any language identically; the cross-language conformance suite
verifies this.

When a query emits JSON, it SHOULD use these shapes (the field a consumer parses is the same in every
language; only the function-name *value* is language-natural — `a::b` vs `a.b`):

```text
show     [ { "fn", "inferred":[…], "direct":[…], "unresolved":bool, "fs"?:[…], "hosts"?:[…] } ]
where    { "effect", "directly":[fn…], "inherited":[fn…] }
callers  { "of":[fn…], "direct":[fn…], "transitive":[fn…] }
map      { "<module>": { "effects":[…], "functions":int } }
```

`show` carries the report's optional refinement fields (`fs`/`hosts`/…) only when the engine resolved
them (§2 omission rules apply); the four required fields are always present. `map` buckets by module —
a function with no module beyond the root goes to `(root)` (§6.1), never its own pseudo-module.

### 3.2 Pre-edit and structural tools (SHOULD)

Two tools answer what an agent asks *around* an edit — deterministically, where a model would otherwise
guess (and, the evidence shows, under-count):

- **whatif `<fn>` `<Effect>`** — the **pre-edit verdict**. Crosses the blast radius (every transitive caller
  of `<fn>` would gain `<Effect>`) with the active policy and reports which functions would **violate** a
  `deny`/`pure` boundary — *before* the edit, instead of edit → run the gate → revert. It is the pre-edit
  form of **AS-EFF-006**.
- **rewire `<baseline>`** — the **de-wiring / structural-regression** check. Diffs the current call graph
  against a baseline and flags edges a function **dropped** (a call it made before and no longer makes). An
  effect gate checks effect *boundaries*, not correctness, so it can be satisfied by *disconnecting*
  functionality — a function stops calling the chain that performs a forbidden effect, the gate passes, the
  feature breaks. That removal is invisible to the effect diff (a pure function dropping a call changes no
  effect) but present in the call graph. rewire is the **structural dual of the baseline guard
  (AS-EFF-005)**: 005 flags an effect *gained* versus the baseline, rewire flags a call *dropped*. It is
  **advisory** — run it ALONGSIDE the policy gate: a green gate **plus** a clean rewire means the boundary
  was respected *without* gutting the feature. A gate alone is necessary, never sufficient.

Their JSON shapes (the verdict + blast radius the conformance suite pins across both engines):

```text
whatif   { "of":[fn…], "effect", "affected":[fn…], "violations":[ { "fn", "rule" } ], "ok":bool }
rewire   { "dropped":[ { "caller", "no_longer_calls":[fn…] } ] }
```

## 4. The trust contract — the core of candor

The defining rule: **an implementation must never report a function as effect-free when it could not
actually determine that.** A call it cannot resolve to a concrete target — dynamic dispatch over an
unknown type, a function value / callback, reflection — MUST contribute `Unknown` to that function's
effect set and set `unresolved: true`. It must not be silently assumed pure.

For a consumer, this means:

- `inferred` is **authoritative** for what the implementation resolved.
- When `unresolved` is true (or `Unknown` is present), the set **may be incomplete** — read the
  source for that function before relying on its effects.

An implementation MAY treat dispatch over a curated set of conventionally-pure standard-library
traits/interfaces (formatting, equality, hashing, cloning) as resolved-pure, to avoid flooding
reports with false `Unknown`s — but MUST document which, and MUST NOT extend it to anything where an
effect could plausibly hide (iterators, callbacks, I/O traits, finalizers).

A method *inherited* by a type — a trait default/provided method, or a concrete method on a base
class the type does not override — is a **resolved** call, not an `Unknown`: it lands on that inherited
body, whose effects MUST be attributed. Reporting it `Unknown` is unsound in the noisy direction (it
masks the inherited body's real effects, since an unresolved dispatch also stops propagation). An
`Unknown` from dispatch is justified only when the target is *genuinely* indeterminate — a value
implementing a trait/interface the implementation declares but whose concrete implementor it cannot
see (a DI-wired strategy, a `dyn`/virtual call with no visible impl). The optional `unknownWhy` field
records this distinction per function so a consumer (and the implementer) can tell irreducible opacity
(`reflect:`, `native:`) from the improvable kind (`dispatch:` — often resolved by widening the
analysed inputs to include the missing implementor).

## 5. Capabilities (conformance)

Conformance needs a way for a function to *declare* the effects it may perform. The canonical
mechanism is a **capability passed as a typed parameter**: holding a value of a capability type
declares the corresponding effect. Examples: candor-Rust's own `&Fs` token; a real
[cap-std](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cap-std) `&Dir`; a dependency-injected collaborator in
Java/C#. An implementation maps capability types → declared effects.

This is deliberately aligned with capability-secure and dependency-injection styles — the goal is
that a function's *signature* tells you its effect surface.

## 6. Diagnostics (`AS-EFF-00x`)

Shared codes (the `AS-EFF` prefix is historical — "AgentScript effect", the project's origin):

| Code | Meaning | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| `AS-EFF-001` | performs an effect it does not declare | conformance |
| `AS-EFF-002` | declares a capability it never uses | conformance |
| `AS-EFF-003` | makes unresolved calls; effect set not provably complete — cannot be certified | conformance |
| `AS-EFF-004` | uses ambient authority directly | no-ambient |
| `AS-EFF-005` | gained an effect versus the baseline | baseline guard |
| `AS-EFF-006` | (transitively) performs an effect a declared policy forbids | policy |
| `AS-EFF-007` | performs an injection-class effect on caller-derived input (**heuristic, advisory**) | risk |
| `AS-EFF-008` | (transitively) reaches a literal (host / command / path) outside a declared allowlist, or one it cannot see | policy |
| `AS-EFF-009` | (transitively) calls into a layer a declared dependency rule forbids | policy |
| `AS-EFF-010` | a boundary effect leaked into a layer it was not in, versus a baseline (containment regression) | containment |

The program entry point (e.g. `main`) is exempt from `AS-EFF-001` — it legitimately mints/holds the
whole capability bundle.

A **literal-allowlist** policy rule, `allow <Effect> [in <scope>] <value>...`, constrains *which* values a
scope's effect may reach (AS-EFF-008). Three effects carry a literal surface: `Net` hosts, `Exec`
commands, and `Fs` paths — checked against the transitive `hosts`/`cmds`/`paths` detail, so it catches a
value that lives in a deep or cross-crate callee, matched per-effect (host by name, command by basename,
path by prefix). It certifies the *visible* surface only (see SEMANTICS §6); pair it with a
`deny Unknown <scope>` rule to also forbid the unverifiable case in a scope.

A **layering** policy rule, `forbid <A> -> <B>`, constrains *who* a layer may depend on: no function in
scope `A` may transitively call into scope `B` (AS-EFF-009) — the dependency-direction boundary, checked
over the call graph (see SEMANTICS §6). Together the three policy rule kinds — `deny`/`pure` (what a
layer does), `allow Net` (which endpoints), and `forbid ->` (who it depends on) — make `CANDOR_POLICY`
an architecture-as-code layer.

### 6.1 Containment — the architecture-quality signal (deliberately not a "score")

candor defines **no single quality score**. Raw effect *counts* are domain-dependent — a database app
performs `Db` in most functions, which is not a defect — so any rolled-up grade would be meaningless
across domains and gameable. The domain-independent signal is **dispersion**: how well an effect that
*should* live in a dedicated layer actually stays there. A `Db`-heavy app with all `Db` in `dao` is
well-architected; one with `Db` in `model`, `controllers`, **and** `dao` is leaky — regardless of how
much `Db` it does. The total is domain-dependent; the dispersion is an architecture fact.

Two classes of effect:

- **boundary** — `Db`, `Net`, `Exec`, `Fs`, `Ipc`. These *should* be contained in a dedicated layer;
  their dispersion is the signal.
- **ambient** — `Log`, `Clock`, `Rand`, `Env`. Cross-cutting by nature (logging/timestamps everywhere is
  normal), so they are reported but **not** scored. `Unknown` is excluded entirely (it is a visibility
  property, not an effect).

A **layer** is inferred from the function name with no configuration: strip the longest module/package
prefix shared by *every* function (the codebase root), and the next segment is the layer (`pgman::app::…`
→ `app`; `com.example.dao.…` → `dao`; a multi-crate report → the crate). A function with no module
beyond the root (a free function, a root-package class) buckets into `(root)` rather than becoming its
own pseudo-layer.

For each boundary effect, **containment** is the share of its *direct* occurrences that fall in its
dominant layer (100% = fully contained). This is reported **per effect**, as a diagnostic — never summed
into one number.

**The ratchet (`AS-EFF-010`).** Given a baseline report, an implementation compares the *set of layers*
each boundary effect appears in. If an effect appears in a layer it was **not** in before, that is a
containment regression — `AS-EFF-010`, and the check fails (the gate). The reverse — an effect that
*left* a layer — SHOULD be reported as an improvement (informative, not a failure). Because this compares
a codebase to *itself* over time, it is domain-independent and not gameable by renaming, and is the form
suitable for CI. The unsupervised per-layer diagnostic is a heuristic that assumes layer-organized code;
the ratchet is the robust form. An implementation that supports containment MUST treat it as a diagnostic
+ trend gate and MUST NOT present a single aggregate score.

### 6.2 The policy DSL (normative)

The policy modes (AS-EFF-006/008/009) and the `whatif` tool (§3.2) all read one **policy file** (the Rust
and JVM engines take its path from `CANDOR_POLICY`). For the gate to mean the same thing in every language
the grammar must be fixed, not merely "some rules text" — so this section is **normative**: a conformant
policy reader parses exactly this, and the cross-impl suite checks it (§7).

**Lexical.** One rule per line. A `#` begins a comment to end-of-line; blank lines and comment-only lines
are ignored. A line is split into tokens on runs of whitespace; the first token is the **rule kind**. A
line whose kind is unrecognized, or that is malformed for its kind, is **ignored with a warning** — never
silently treated as a stricter or looser rule (silent reinterpretation is the one thing a security gate
must not do).

**The four rule kinds:**

```
deny    <Effect>… [<scope>]          # AS-EFF-006 — what a layer may NOT do
pure    [<scope>]                    # AS-EFF-006 — shorthand for "deny every effect"
allow   <Effect> [in <scope>] <v>…   # AS-EFF-008 — which literals an effect may reach
forbid  <A> -> <B>                   # AS-EFF-009 — A may not depend on B
```

- **`deny`** — the tokens after `deny` are read left to right: each token that names an effect (the §1
  vocabulary, **or** the literal `Unknown`) joins the forbidden set; the **first** token that is not a
  known effect is the **scope**, and **ends the rule** (any further tokens are ignored). A `deny` that
  names no known effect is **dropped** (it is not a `pure` rule — that distinction is load-bearing).
  `Unknown` is denyable precisely so `deny Unknown <scope>` forbids the *unverifiable* case (§6,
  AS-EFF-008's companion).
- **`pure`** — an empty forbidden set, meaning **every** effect; the optional next token is the scope.
  `pure parse` ≡ "functions in `parse` must be effect-free."
- **`allow`** — the effect MUST be one of the three that carry a literal surface (`Net`, `Exec`, `Fs`); an
  `allow` for any other effect is dropped with a warning. An optional `in <scope>` follows; the remaining
  tokens are the allowed values (≥1 required, else the rule is dropped).
- **`forbid`** — two scopes separated by a literal `->` token (`forbid domain -> infra`). A line missing
  the arrow or either scope is dropped.

**Scope matching** (`<scope>` against a function's fully-qualified name) is **by path segment, not
substring**. Split both on the language's path separator (`::` in Rust, `.` on the JVM). The scope matches
iff its segments appear as a **contiguous run** in the name where every segment **except the last** matches
exactly and the **last** segment is a **prefix** of its name-segment. So scope `domain` matches
`app::domain::handle`, `domain::handle`, and the function `domain_logic` (last-segment prefix), but **not**
`subdomain` or `not_my_domain` (substring, not a segment boundary); scope `net::client` matches
`crate::net::client_pool::get` but not `crate::network::client` (intermediate segments are exact, not
prefixes). An **absent/empty scope means the whole compilation unit** (matches every function).

**Literal matching** (`allow`) is **per effect**: a `Net` host matches by hostname with the port ignored
(`api.stripe.com` allows `api.stripe.com:443`); an `Exec` command matches by basename
(`git` allows `/usr/bin/git`); an `Fs` path matches by **path-boundary-respecting prefix** (an allowed
directory covers itself and everything beneath it, but `/etc/app` does **not** cover `/etc/apppwned`, and a
reached path that climbs out via `..` is never covered). Matching is over the **transitive**
`hosts`/`cmds`/`paths` surface (§2), so a value buried in a deep or cross-crate callee is still checked.

## 7. Conformance checklist for an implementation

An implementation conforms to candor-spec if it:

1. resolves call targets using type information (not purely syntactically);
2. computes a per-function **transitive** effect set;
3. emits the §2 report schema;
4. honours the §4 trust contract — unresolved ⇒ `Unknown`, never silent-pure;
5. supports at least **audit**, **JSON**, and **baseline-guard** modes;
6. uses the §1 vocabulary and §6 codes where they apply, and — if it enforces any policy mode — parses
   the §6.2 policy DSL exactly (so a policy file means the same thing in every language);
7. is honest in its own docs about what it cannot see;
8. declares the **spec version** it implements (the envelope's `spec`, §2.1) and keeps it in step with
   this document.

It SHOULD additionally:

9. emit the **call-graph sidecar** (§2.2) — required if it answers any caller-direction query
   (`callers`/`whatif`/`rewire`), since the report alone omits pure functions;
10. expose the read-only queries (§3.1) and the pre-edit/structural tools (§3.2) under
    **cross-language-consistent** names and shapes, so an agent uses any implementation's output
    identically. The cross-impl conformance suite checks this for effect sets, the `whatif` verdict +
    blast radius, the `rewire` verdict, and the `§6.2` policy-DSL parse.

## 8. Changelog

The spec version is the contract version (§2.1) — bumped on additive changes (a minor: a new optional
field or `AS-EFF` code) or breaking ones (a major: the envelope reshape, a removed field). Implementations
declare it via the envelope's `spec`.

- **0.3** — additive over 0.2 (wire-compatible; a 0.2 reader still parses a 0.3 report):
  - `AS-EFF-006` (policy `deny`/`pure`), `AS-EFF-007` (heuristic `risk`), `AS-EFF-008` (literal allowlists
    `allow Net`/`Exec`/`Fs`), `AS-EFF-009` (layering `forbid ->`), `AS-EFF-010` (containment ratchet);
  - report fields `calls`, `fs`, `hosts`, `cmds`, `paths`, `unknownWhy` (the per-fn Unknown-origin tag),
    `entryPoint` (the runtime-invoked reachability-root flag);
  - the `containment` mode + §6.1 (the not-a-score architecture signal);
  - the envelope's `spec` field itself (§2.1);
  - **documentation-only, no wire change** (a 0.3 report is byte-identical): §2.2 specifies the call-graph
    sidecar an implementation already emits; §3.1–3.2 specify the read-only queries and the
    pre-edit/structural tools (`whatif`, `rewire`) as cross-language-consistent SHOULDs; checklist items
    9–10 (§7) make both SHOULD-level; §6.2 fixes the **policy DSL** (the `deny`/`pure`/`allow`/`forbid`
    grammar, segment-based scope matching, per-effect literal matching) as a normative grammar so the
    gate means the same thing in every language. The report schema is unchanged, so the spec version
    stays **0.3**.
- **0.2** — the self-describing `{ candor, functions }` envelope with a provenance header (`version`,
  `toolchain`); cross-crate inheritance by `hash`; version-aware trust.
- **0.1** — the bare top-level array of function entries (still accepted by readers during migration).
